# NOTE: rwsdk needs its own base reference (rwsdk-reference) because it uses a
# fundamentally different architecture than vite-reference:
# - Entry point: src/worker.tsx with defineApp() (not worker/index.ts with Hono)
# - Build: rwsdk/vite + @cloudflare/vite-plugin (not standard Vite)
# - Rendering: React Server Components (not client-side SPA)
# - Routing: rwsdk/router (not React Router)
# - Config: vite.config.mts (not .ts)
